    <h1>Signature Campaign for a Fair, Reasonable, and Equitable Pension</h1>

    <h2>Legislative Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      This campaign seeks the amendment of <b>R.A. 8291</b> to include the provision: 
      <i>‚ÄúMonthly pensions shall automatically increase whenever there is an increase in the salary of the position at which the member retired.‚Äù</i>
      The objective of this amendment is to ensure fairness, equity, and consistency in the retirement benefits system for all government employees.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Laws on Automatic Pension Increase</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>R.A. 9946</b> ‚Äì Automatically increases the pensions of retired members of the Judiciary.</li>
      <li><b>R.A. 11059</b> ‚Äì Grants salary upgrades to eligible Ombudsman officials and employees.</li>
      <li><b>R.A. 10071</b> ‚Äì Provides automatic pension increases for prosecutors in the National Prosecution Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coverage of Existing Laws</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>R.A. 9946:</b> Justices, Judges, and their surviving legitimate spouses.</li>
      <li><b>R.A. 11059:</b> Ombudsman, Deputies, the Special Prosecutor, and qualified legal employees from SG 26‚Äì29.</li>
      <li><b>R.A. 10071:</b> Officers and members of the National Prosecution Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rationale for Amendment</h2>
    <p>
      While existing statutes extend benefits to select groups, the majority of government employees and executives remain excluded from automatic pension increases. 
      This proposal advocates for inclusivity, ensuring that all retirees receive equitable treatment. The amendment would:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Promote Fairness:</b> Address disparities in retirement benefits across government sectors.</li>
      <li><b>Ensure Recognition:</b> Honor the contributions of all government employees, regardless of rank or position.</li>
      <li><b>Strengthen Cohesion:</b> Foster a unified and equitable retirement system.</li>
      <li><b>Encourage Motivation:</b> Inspire continued dedication and service among current government personnel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <p>
      This initiative does not oppose the benefits already granted under R.A. 9946, 11059, and 10071. Rather, it seeks to <b>extend similar provisions to all government retirees</b>, thereby creating a more balanced and equitable retirement framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call on our colleagues, stakeholders, and the broader community to support this proposal by signing the campaign and casting a vote in favor of its adoption.
